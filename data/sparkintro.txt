Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing.
Run programs up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory, or 10x faster on disk.
Apache Spark has an advanced DAG execution engine that supports cyclic data flow and in-memory computing.
Write applications quickly in Java, Scala, Python, R.
Spark offers over 80 high-level operators that make it easy to build parallel apps. 
And you can use it interactively from the Scala, Python and R shells.
Combine SQL, streaming, and complex analytics.
Spark powers a stack of libraries including SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX, and Spark Streaming. 
You can combine these libraries seamlessly in the same application.
Spark runs on Hadoop, Mesos, standalone, or in the cloud. It can access diverse data sources including HDFS, Cassandra, HBase, and S3.
You can run Spark using its standalone cluster mode, on EC2, on Hadoop YARN, or on Apache Mesos. 
Access data in HDFS, Cassandra, HBase, Hive, Tachyon, and any Hadoop data source.
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.
Documentation for Python's standard library, along with tutorials and guides, are available online.
